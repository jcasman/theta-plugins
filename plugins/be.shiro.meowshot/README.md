## Description
THETA plug-in supporting cat shooting.  
  
Get a cat's attention by a voice, and take a picture.  
  
This plug-in has three commands.  
* Take a 360 degree picture remotely.
* Play a cute cat voice from a speaker in THETA remotely.
* Record your voice using a microphone in THETA and use it instead of cat voice.
  
You don't need to install a smartphone app. Just need a web browser.  
  
## What's New
* Operation sounds except shutter sound are played even if shutter volume is muted.
* Turns Wi-Fi on as AP mode automatically if the Wi-Fi is turned off.
* Bug fix: The remote shutter does not work if the THETA is not in still image capture mode before the plug-in starts.
